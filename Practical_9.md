# Week 9

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I explored the power of **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)** in Prac 9 and how it enhances CSS development with features such as variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and modular file structures. I applied these features to build a fully responsive personal portfolio site using a custom Sass setup. Additionally, I automated my workflow using **Gulp** and **BrowserSync** to continuously compile SCSS files and reload the browser during development.

**Resources Referenced:**
- [Sass Official Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
- [Gulp Documentation](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [BrowserSync Guide](https://browsersync.io/docs)

## Estimated Hours
I spent around **5â€“6 hours** working on this practical, including setting up the Gulp workflow, debugging SCSS errors, and designing the responsive portfolio site.

## Content Insights
Through this practical, I gained hands-on experience in modular SCSS development. I used:
- **Variables** for storing color palettes, font sizes, and spacing units.
- **Nesting** for writing cleaner and more structured styles inside component blocks.
- **Mixins** for hover effects, responsive media queries, and reusable styles.
- **@extend** for reusing shared styles across selectors.
- **Partial files** using `@use` to keep the project well-organized and maintainable.

I also set up a Gulp workflow to automate SCSS compilation, minification, and browser reloading using **BrowserSync**, which significantly streamlined my development process.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning Sass and setting up an automated workflow with Gulp has improved my confidence in front-end development. These are **industry-relevant tools** used by professional web developers for maintainable, scalable, and fast CSS workflows. The experience of creating a custom responsive portfolio without any templates allowed me to showcase my skills in real-world scenarios. Moreover, solving issues with namespace conflicts and modular imports gave me a deeper understanding of how large-scale projects handle CSS architecture. These skills are highly beneficial for future group projects and **career opportunities in front-end web development**.
