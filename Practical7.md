## Week 7  
### Estimated Hours  
**9-10 hours**  

## Learning Activities & Resources  
This week, I focused on improving my PHP skills by working on **The Advice Shop Project**. To enhance my understanding, I referred to the following resources:  

- [PHP Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/) – Official PHP documentation  
- [W3Schools PHP Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php/) – Basics and advanced PHP concepts  
- [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/) – Best practices and modern PHP development  
- [YouTube: PHP for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c) – A comprehensive beginner-friendly guide  

## Content Insights  
The Advice Shop project was an exciting opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of core PHP concepts while building a functional and dynamic website. The goal was to implement a proper login system, enhance user experience, and incorporate fundamental PHP features such as **echo, conditional statements, loops, functions, and include statements**.

### Features Implemented:  
1. **Echoing Different Kinds of HTML:**  
   - Used `echo` to dynamically generate HTML content based on user interaction.

2. **Decisions - if/else Statements:**  
   - Implemented authentication checks and user access control.  
   - Used `if/else` to handle login validation and error messages.

3. **Repetition - Loops (for, while, foreach):**  
   - Used `foreach` to iterate through navigation items.  
   - Applied `for` loops to generate dynamic content in the dashboard.

4. **Functions - With Parameters:**  
   - Created reusable functions for user authentication and database operations.  
   - Functions took parameters for flexible usage.

5. **Include Statements - Reusable Header and Footer:**  
   - Used `include` statements to maintain a common `inc_header.php` and `inc_footer.php` for consistency.  

### Challenges and Solutions:  
1. **Database Connection Issues:**  
   - Faced an issue with an undefined database variable `$conn`.  
   - Fixed by correctly including `dbconnect.php` and verifying variable names.  

2. **Session Handling Warnings:**  
   - Encountered warning: `session_start(): Ignoring session_start() because a session is already active.`  
   - Resolved by checking if a session was already started before calling `session_start()`.  

3. **Login and Redirection Issues:**  
   - Users were not being redirected correctly after login.  
   - Fixed by ensuring `header("Location: dashboard.php")` was executed before any output.  

4. **Inline Form Display Issue:**  
   - The signup form wasn’t displaying inline properly.  
   - Resolved using `display: inline-block;` in CSS and adjusting margins.  

### Enhancements and Future Improvements:  
- Implement a **password reset feature** to improve security.  
- Add an **admin panel** to manage users and advice categories dynamically.  
- Improve UI/UX using **Bootstrap** for better responsiveness.  
- Optimize **database queries** to enhance performance.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights  
PHP is a widely used **server-side scripting language** that powers many web applications, including **WordPress, Joomla, and Laravel-based sites**. 
Learning and working with PHP enhances employability in several ways:  

- **Web Development Opportunities:** Many companies use PHP for their websites, creating job opportunities for PHP developers.  
- **CMS Customization & Freelancing:** PHP knowledge is valuable for customizing WordPress themes and Joomla extensions.  
- **Backend Development & APIs:** Many backend roles require PHP skills, especially in creating APIs and handling databases.  
- **Scalability & Open Source Contributions:** Contributing to PHP-based projects on GitHub can improve career prospects.  

## Conclusion  
This project was an excellent hands-on experience that strengthened my PHP skills. By implementing a **functional login system** and
modularizing the code, I improved my understanding of **session management, authentication, and database interactions**. I look forward to expanding my PHP expertise and integrating **advanced features like AJAX, API development, and security enhancements** in future projects.
